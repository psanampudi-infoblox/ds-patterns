# REST vs gRPC for Microservices in Kubernetes (2025)

## Context
In 2025, it’s still perfectly valid to start a microservices journey with **HTTPS/JSON for internal communication**. gRPC brings performance and strict contracts, but REST remains simpler, more flexible, and easier for schema-driven, dynamic platforms.

---

## When HTTPS/JSON is the Better Default
- **Dynamic modeling & uniform APIs**: Easier to evolve schemas without re-generating stubs.
- **Polyglot + fast iteration**: Schema registry + OpenAPI workflows work well across teams.
- **Tooling & debuggability**: Curl, Postman, proxies, logs—every team member can interact easily.

---

## Performance Tips for REST in Kubernetes
- **HTTP/2**: Enable in-cluster for multiplexing and lower latency.
- **Compression**: Use Brotli or gzip for JSON.
- **Batching**: Provide bulk endpoints to reduce N+1 calls.
- **Async jobs**: Offload long tasks to Kafka/NATS/etc., expose status via REST.
- **Timeouts & retries**: Enforce client/server deadlines; avoid duplicate retries with mesh.

---

## Contracts Without gRPC
- **OpenAPI 3.1 + JSON Schema** as your IDL.
- **Content-type versioning** (e.g., `application/vnd.acme.asset+json;v=2025-09-01`).
- **Evolution rules**: additive-only by default; explicit deprecation windows.
- **Problem+JSON** (RFC 9457) for structured error responses.
- **Sparse fieldsets**: `?fields=id,name,tags`.
- **PATCH**: support JSON Merge Patch or JSON Patch.

---

## Streaming in REST
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: one-way, proxy-friendly streaming.
- **WebSockets**: for rare bi-directional needs.
- **NDJSON**: for incremental responses over HTTP/2.

---

## Observability
- **Structured logs**: include request IDs, tenant IDs, schema versions.
- **Metrics**: requests, latency buckets, payload size, error codes.
- **Tracing**: W3C TraceContext propagation + server interceptors.

---

## Hybrid & Migration Path
1. Start REST-only with good discipline.
2. Monitor hotspots (latency, CPU, QPS).
3. If a boundary needs optimization:
   - Switch to **gRPC** for that path, or
   - Add **binary REST** (CBOR, MessagePack).

---

## Checklist
- [ ] HTTP/2 + Brotli enabled in-cluster.
- [ ] OpenAPI schema registry with CI enforcement.
- [ ] Problem+JSON for errors.
- [ ] Cursor-based pagination, bulk mutations, idempotency keys.
- [ ] Sparse fieldsets and filter conventions.
- [ ] Deadlines/timeouts for all calls.
- [ ] NDJSON/SSE/WebSockets where appropriate.

---

## When to Choose gRPC from Day 1
- Ultra-low-latency, **chatty RPC** at huge QPS.
- Heavy **bi-directional streaming**.
- Strict proto ecosystem adoption across many teams.

---

## Bottom Line
Starting with **HTTPS/JSON is absolutely fine in 2025**. You get model flexibility, strong tooling, and wide interoperability. Add gRPC *surgically* only where performance or streaming really demand it.
