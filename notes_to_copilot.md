- Beautified `patterns/fail-fast.md`: normalized headings (H1/H2), fixed list formatting, consolidated duplicate content, and added a concise conclusion/callout. No semantic changes beyond minor clarity edits.
- Added `patterns/SalesForceAndSaaS.md` content: covered SF→SaaS callouts (Apex/Flow/External Services, events), SaaS→SF updates (REST/Composite/Bulk, Platform Events, Apex REST), auth (OAuth), identity/SSO, packaging choices, and ops guardrails.
 - Added Glossary to `patterns/data-migrations.md` with definitions for Up/Down, forward‑fix, EMC, dual‑write, backfill, online DDL, idempotency, tenancy models, and guardrail terms.
